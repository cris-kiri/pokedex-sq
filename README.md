# Pokedex-SQ

My personal project for Dev Academy focusing on implementing software quality measures and applying best practices under the guise of a Pokedex web app.

The pokedex will be a simple replication of the Pokemon identification device where the user can search for a Pokemon and get information regarding its stats, height, weight, skills and more. The reason for the simplicity is to practice software quality measures and best practices to increase my sense of code quality.

<summary>Original repo details</summary>
This is a starter project that uses Vite to bundle a React app and Express to serve it in production. Express is used in development to serve an API server.

Vite React App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Express API Server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Requests to `http://localhost:5173/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3000/api`.
